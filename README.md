# CryptoReal™ Project: Decoding the Fabric of Reality

**Founded:** February 2026
**Location:** Yerevan, Armenia
**Discipline:** Non-linear dynamics, Chaos Theory, and Stochastic Electrodynamics.

## What is CryptoReal?
CryptoReal is an independent research initiative focused on finding hidden correlations between macroscopic events (Observer intention/Environmental shifts) and microscopic stochastic processes (True Random Number Generators, hardware noise). 

While classical physics views environmental noise as pure entropy, CryptoReal hypothesizes that intention and macro-events create measurable "information pressure" or turbulence in the fundamental medium, altering probability distributions.

## Current Objectives:
1. Build a high-speed data collection pipeline for hardware noise.
2. Apply Bayesian statistics and Hidden Markov Models to detect signal anomalies.
3. Prove that probability is a dynamic, not a static, property of reality.
