# CryptoReal: Decrypting the Fabric of Probability

**Location:** Yerevan, Armenia
**Started:** February 2026

## What does "CryptoReal" mean?
It is the fusion of **Cryptography** and **Reality**. 
Modern physics assumes that background noise and quantum fluctuations are purely random—meaningless static. CryptoReal operates on a different hypothesis: what we call "random noise" is actually encrypted information. The goal of this project is to build the decryption key.

## The Core Problem
Science currently treats probability as a static, isolated phenomenon. If you flip a coin, the odds are 50/50, completely detached from what is happening in the room. But what if probability is dynamic? 

I am investigating the hypothesis that macroscopic events—such as human intention, the physical approach of a person (a "guest" entering a space), or sudden environmental shifts—create turbulence in the underlying fundamental medium (the ether/information field). This turbulence subtly alters the probability distributions of microscopic chaotic systems. 

We are not trying to predict financial markets or crypto prices. We are trying to hack the mechanics of cause and effect itself.

## The Methodology
To prove that macro-events influence micro-chaos, you cannot rely on human-flipped coins. You need massive, high-speed data.

1. **Hardware Data Collection:** Using True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) capturing thermal and quantum hardware noise.
2. **High-Performance Processing:** Writing raw, optimized C++ code to capture and process millions of bits of noise per second.
3. **Statistical Decryption:** Applying Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Bayesian inference, and Ramsey theory concepts to detect momentary drops in entropy or hidden patterns that correlate exactly with documented macro-events in the real world.

## The Mission
To prove that probability is not blind, and that the physical environment reacts to information pressure long before the event actually occurs.
